To use differential privacy, you need to set a privacy budget. 
The privacy budget is a parameter that controls the amount of noise that is added to the data. 
A higher privacy budget will result in less noise being added to the data, but it will also reduce the accuracy of the statistical analysis.

Once you have set a privacy budget, you can use a variety of different tools and libraries to add noise to your data and perform differential privacy analysis.
